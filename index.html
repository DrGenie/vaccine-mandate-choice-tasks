        <h1>To mandate or not to mandate?</h1>
        <h2>Public preferences for vaccine mandates in Australia and international comparators</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Brief Background:</strong> Government COVID‑19 vaccine mandates have included employment and public space mandates. This study aims to quantify public preferences and trade‑offs among key features of future vaccine mandates.
        </p>

      <h3>Attribute Scorecard</h3>
      <p>
        Allocate a total of <strong>100 points</strong> among the following attributes to indicate their importance.
        Higher scores mean the attribute matters more when choosing a preferred vaccine mandate.
        If you do not consider an attribute relevant, please assign it <strong>0 points</strong> so that the total equals 100.

      <h2>Scenario Description</h2>
      <p>
        Imagine a future where a new pandemic has emerged, caused by a novel virus different from COVID‑19 but with similar global impact.
        Safe and effective vaccines have been developed and are available to everyone.
        Governments worldwide are considering different ways to control the spread of this new disease – including making vaccines mandatory.
        In this survey, you will compare two different hypothetical vaccine mandate policies and decide which one you prefer.
