      <h1>To mandate or not to mandate? Vaccine Mandate Survey (For Research Team Only!)</h1>
      <h2>Understanding Vaccine Mandate Features</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome! In this survey, we're exploring preferences about how vaccination policies 
        might be designed if a new pandemic (distinct from COVID-19) emerged and safe, 
        effective vaccines became widely available.
      </p>
      <p>
        We’ll introduce six key features of a hypothetical vaccine mandate—from who must get vaccinated 
        to what it takes to end the mandate. Then, you’ll see nine scenarios comparing two different 
        mandate configurations (A and B). For each scenario, please select which option you prefer.
        You’ll also let us know if you’d choose <em>“no mandate at all”</em> if that were possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        This survey is for <strong>research purposes only</strong>. Your responses will remain confidential. 
        Once you finish, your answers will be sent to the research team via email 
        (with an option to download them). 
        Thank you for your time and cooperation.

    <!-- Slide 2: Tutorial – Scope of Mandate -->
    <div class="slide" id="slide-2">
      <h2>Tutorial: Who Might Be Covered by a Mandate?</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Scope of mandate</strong> refers to which groups or individuals the policy compels to get vaccinated.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>High‑risk occupations only:</strong> 
        <span class="icon-tooltip" 
              title="Only individuals working in frontline or high-exposure roles (e.g. healthcare, emergency services) are required to vaccinate. This limits the mandate to those most at risk of contracting or spreading infection.">⚠️</span>
        Applies exclusively to those with elevated occupational risk.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>All occupations and public spaces:</strong> 
        <span class="icon-tooltip" 
              title="Everyone aged 18+ must be vaccinated, regardless of their profession, to access workplaces or public venues. This is a broad policy that applies to the entire adult population.">🌐</span>
        Covers all adults without limiting by job type.

    <!-- Slide 3: Tutorial – Infection Threshold -->
    <div class="slide" id="slide-3">
      <h2>Tutorial: When a Mandate Might Start</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Infection threshold</strong> is the level of reported cases at which the mandate is activated.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>50 cases per 100k with 10% weekly increase:</strong>
        <span class="icon-tooltip" 
              title="An early trigger that intervenes when relatively few cases are reported, aiming to prevent large outbreaks.">🟢</span>
        <br>
        Mandate activates quickly at lower infection levels.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>100 cases per 100k with 15% weekly increase:</strong>
        <span class="icon-tooltip" 
              title="A moderate threshold, balancing the need for intervention with fewer restrictions until cases climb to this point.">🟠</span>
        <br>
        Mandate starts once the outbreak is noticeable but not severe.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>200 cases per 100k with 20% weekly increase:</strong>
        <span class="icon-tooltip" 
              title="A late trigger that waits until transmission is higher, which might risk more widespread infection before action is taken.">🔴</span>
        <br>
        Mandate only activates when cases are already quite high.

    <!-- Slide 4: Tutorial – Coverage Requirement -->
    <div class="slide" id="slide-4">
      <h2>Tutorial: When a Mandate Might End</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Vaccine coverage requirement</strong> is the percentage of people who must be vaccinated before the mandate is lifted.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>50% coverage:</strong>
        <span class="icon-tooltip" 
              title="Once half the population is vaccinated, the mandate ends. This means it lifts relatively early, leaving some unvaccinated.">

        </span>
        Lifts once half are vaccinated.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>70% coverage:</strong>
        <span class="icon-tooltip" 
              title="About 70% of the population must be vaccinated. This is often considered a widely accepted threshold for substantial community protection, though exact figures vary.">

        </span>
        Ends once a large majority is covered.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>90% coverage:</strong>
        <span class="icon-tooltip" 
              title="Requires nearly everyone to be vaccinated, offering strong community protection but also extending the mandate significantly.">

    <div class="slide" id="slide-5">
      <h2>Tutorial: Possible Incentives</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Incentives</strong> are benefits provided to encourage people to get vaccinated.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>No incentives:</strong>
        <span class="icon-tooltip" 
              title="No special rewards or financial benefits are given, beyond general health recommendations.">🚫</span>
        Individuals receive no additional perks.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Paid time off (1–3 days):</strong>
        <span class="icon-tooltip" 
              title="Employers offer paid leave for getting vaccinated or recovering from side effects, reducing wage loss.">🕒</span>
        Lowers the economic barrier to vaccination.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Government subsidies/discounts:</strong>
        <span class="icon-tooltip" 
              title="Monetary incentives, such as direct rebates or discounts on other services, for those who get vaccinated.">💸</span>
        Financial encouragement to boost participation.

    <!-- Slide 6: Tutorial – Exemption Policy -->
    <div class="slide" id="slide-6">
      <h2>Tutorial: Who Can Opt Out?</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Exemption policy</strong> specifies acceptable reasons to avoid mandatory vaccination.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Medical exemptions only:</strong>
        <span class="icon-tooltip" 
              title="Strictly limited to those with certified medical conditions that contraindicate the vaccine. Proof is typically required.">🩺</span>
        Very narrow and requires official documentation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Medical and religious exemptions:</strong>
        <span class="icon-tooltip" 
              title="Expands beyond strictly medical reasons, allowing exemptions for individuals citing sincere religious beliefs.">🩺🙏</span>
        Broader allowance.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Medical, religious, and broad personal belief:</strong>
        <span class="icon-tooltip" 
              title="Permits multiple rationales, including philosophical or personal beliefs, making it the most lenient exemption policy.">🩺🙏💡</span>
        Most flexible, leading to higher potential opt-outs.

      <h2>Tutorial: Cost or Burden of Getting Vaccinated</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Opportunity cost</strong> represents the expense or inconvenience of vaccination—time, travel, fees.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>No opportunity cost (A$0):</strong>
        <span class="icon-tooltip" 
              title="Completely free and easy access; individuals need no extra money or time away from work.">$0</span>
        No direct burden.

        <strong>Low (A$5):</strong>
        <span class="icon-tooltip" 
              title="Minimal cost, like a cheap bus fare or very brief time off, causing little financial strain.">$</span>
        Small inconvenience.

      <p>
        <strong>Moderate (A$20):</strong>
        <span class="icon-tooltip" 
              title="Notable expense—possible taxi fare, childcare, or partial unpaid leave, which can be a barrier for some.">$$</span>
        May deter those with tight budgets.

      <p>
        <strong>High (A$50):</strong>

    <!-- Slide 8: Scenario Description -->
    <div class="slide" id="slide-8">
      <h2>The Scenario</h2>
      <p>
        Now, imagine a new pandemic caused by a virus distinct from COVID‑19. Safe and effective vaccines are available, 
        and governments are deciding if they should mandate vaccination. 
        Each example policy you’ll see uses the same vaccine but differs in how it is applied—who’s included, 
        when it starts, what coverage is needed to lift it, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        For each scenario, you’ll compare two possible mandates (A and B) and choose your preferred option. 
        You’ll also be asked if you’d rather <em>forgo mandating altogether</em> if that choice were available. 
        Your honest responses will help us understand people’s willingness to accept or reject different mandate features.

          Choosing <em>Mandate A</em> means you accept a narrower scope (high-risk jobs only), 
          an earlier trigger, lower coverage required to end the mandate, no incentives, 
          strictly medical exemptions, and a small fee. 
          Then, you'd confirm whether you'd still keep this option or pick “no mandate” if it were possible.
