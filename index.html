      <h2>Scenario Description</h2>
      <p>
        Imagine a future where a new pandemic has emerged, caused by a novel virus different from COVID-19 but with similar global impact. Safe and effective vaccines have been developed and are available to everyone. Governments around the world are thinking about different ways to control the spread of this new disease, including making vaccines mandatory. These rules could differ in terms of who must get vaccinated, who can be exempt, and how the rules are enforced and lifted. However, in this context, all vaccines have the same characteristics: they are well‐tested for safety, offer protection against the disease, and are effective in preventing severe cases of the illness. While the vaccines might not stop every infection, they significantly reduce the disease's spread and severity. These vaccines are designed to offer lasting protection, although the exact duration may vary. In each choice task, you will compare two different hypothetical policy scenarios regarding these vaccine mandates and decide which one you prefer.

    <!-- Instructions -->
    <section id="instructions">
      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You are asked which vaccine mandate option you would choose (A or B).</li>
        <li>The two vaccine mandates only differ according to the characteristics outlined. All other aspects of the mandates are the same.</li>
        <li>At first glance the vaccine mandates might appear the same, but in fact each one is different.</li>
        <li>We understand that some choices will be difficult to make, but there are no right or wrong answers. We are interested in your opinion.</li>
      </ul>
